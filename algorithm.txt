Algorithm: Calculate Student Performance Status

Input: student_scores[] , attendance_percentage
Output: performance_status

1. Set total = 0
2. For each score in student_scores
      total = total + score
3. average = total / number of scores

4. If attendance_percentage < 75
      performance_status = "At Risk"
   Else
      If average >= 85
           performance_status = "Excellent"
      Else if average >= 60
           performance_status = "Pass"
      Else
           performance_status = "Fail"

5. Display performance_status
